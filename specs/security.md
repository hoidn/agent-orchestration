# Security and Path Safety (Normative)

- Path safety
  - Reject absolute paths and any path containing `..` during validation.
  - Follow symlinks; if the resolved path escapes WORKSPACE, reject the path.
  - Apply checks at load time and before filesystem operations.

Note: These safety checks apply to paths the orchestrator resolves (e.g., `input_file`, `output_file`, `depends_on`, `wait_for`). Child processes invoked by `command`/`provider` can read/write any locations permitted by the OS; use OS/user sandboxing if stricter isolation is required.

- Secrets handling
  - `secrets: string[]` declares environment variable names that MUST be present in the orchestrator environment.
  - Missing secrets cause step failure (exit 2) and populate `error.context.missing_secrets`.
  - Empty-string values count as present.
  - Precedence: if a key exists in both `env` and `secrets`, the child receives the `env` value and it is masked in logs as a secret.
  - Masking: best-effort replacement of known secret values with `***` in logs, state, and prompt audit.

- Environment inheritance
  - Child processes inherit the orchestrator environment, then secrets are overlaid, then step `env` is applied (step `env` wins on conflicts).

- Cross-platform note
  - Examples use POSIX tools (`bash`, `find`, `mv`, `test`). On Windows, use WSL or adapt to PowerShell equivalents.
